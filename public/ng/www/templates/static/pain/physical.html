        A physical therapist may be asked to help with any pain that comes from your muscles and nerves. They can show you exercises and stretches to help reduce this pain.â€¨

        Other ways of reducing pain include using heat, cold, or massage. For instance, the cold sensation from popsicles and ice chips can be really helpful for mouth sores!      </p>
